# Zombie-Apocalypse-Simulator

Created to generate graphical representations of a simulated zombie apocalypse.

There is currently one version available (basic version) but this project will be expanded to include randomness and countermeasures.

Variables:
R0 - This is the basic reproduction number, or how many people a zombie will (theoretically) infect every day
Population - This is the human starting population
zStartingNum - How many zombies there are at time = 0
